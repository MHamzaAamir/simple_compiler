# simple_compiler

Just a simple python script that simulates a compiler for an imaginary language.
The python script implement the lexical analysis and syntax analysis stage of a compiler.
Each line is read, tokenized using regex and verified using CFG rules.
The dependencies include re for regex and nltk's cfg parser for implementing cfg rules.
The input code is fed using a code.txt file.

This simple project was built as part of the Theory Of Automata And Formal Languages Course
